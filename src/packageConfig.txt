IMPORTANT: You need to add the following scripts to your package.json file:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "tsc && vite build",
  "build:dev": "vite build --mode development",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}

Since package.json files can't be modified directly by Lovable, you'll need to add these scripts manually.
